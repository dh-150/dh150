            <h3>Historical Context</h3>
            <p>In a time and nation that struggled to accept racial integration and equality, race films were an uplifting symbol of the black community and its representation in American cinema. Race films catered specifically to a minority audience and were often screened for black moviegoers in designated theaters or matinee times due to segregation laws. This new genre of film was created as a contradictory response to racist stereotypes in D. W. Griffith’s Birth of a Nation blockbuster that hit theaters at the time, prompting a resurgence of discrimination and violence from the Ku Klux Klan.</p>

            <p>While most companies that produced from 1915 to the early 1950s were white-owned, the Lincoln Motion Picture Company was one of the few black-owned companies that made a significant contribution to the growing collection of race films. Launched by brothers George P. and Noble Johnson in 1916, the company was a pioneering experiment that challenged the racial standards of filmmaking. Noble’s fair complexion often led to his being cast as characters of races such as Native American, Latino, Asian, or others deemed “exotic” by racially discriminatory standards. Working on films for Lincoln Motion Picture Company allowed him to identify with African American roles, which would normally otherwise be depicted through racist caricatures and degrading stereotypes. George wrote scripts for all-black casts, allowing black actors to showcase their talent in an accepting space outside of a mainstream Hollywood that would otherwise portray the black community through a prejudiced lens. Having started the first Negro paper in Omaha prior to founding the company and later establishing and running the Pacific Coast News Bureau, George used filmmaking as a way to raise awareness of significant Negro news on a national level.</p>

            <p>However, reaching a wide audience was difficult since they were limited to playing films in special churches, schools, and “Colored Only” theaters. Lack of successful business pushed Noble to leave Lincoln Motion Picture Company to work for Universal Pictures for financial reasons. The studio closed not long after in 1922, short-lived but lasting in effect. The UCLA Young Research Library’s Special Collections houses a physical and digital exhibit recognizing progressive figures like the Johnson brothers and highlighting their accomplishments through Lincoln Motion Picture Company. George died in 1977 and most of his films weren’t stored properly for preservation, but a compilation of newspaper clippings, photographs, publicity material, posters, correspondence, and business records are important remnants of the past that detail his life and legacy.</p>
