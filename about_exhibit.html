            <h1>About the Exhibit</h1><br />
            <p>In a time and nation that struggled to accept racial integration and equality, race films were an uplifting symbol of the black community and their representation in American cinema. Race films catered specifically to black audiences and were screened in designated theaters or matinee times due to Jim Crow segregation. This new genre of film was created in direct response to racist stereotypes in D. W. Griffith’s Birth of a Nation (1915) which also prompted a resurgence of discrimination and violence from the Ku Klux Klan.</p>

            <p>While most companies that produced films from 1915 to the early 1950s were white owned, the Lincoln Motion Picture Company was one of the few black-owned companies that made a significant contribution to the growing collection of race films. Launched by brothers George P. and Noble Johnson in 1916, the company challenged the racial standards of filmmaking. Noble’s complexion often led to his being cast as characters of races such as Native American, Latino, Asian, or others deemed “exotic” by racially discriminatory standards in mainstream films. However, Lincoln Motion Picture Company films allowed him to identify with leading, African American roles which would otherwise be depicted through racist caricatures and degrading stereotypes. George wrote scripts for all-black casts which allowed black actors and actresses to showcase their talent. George P. Johnson established the first weekly, black-operated newspaper in Tulsa, Oklahoma and established and ran the Pacific Coast News Bureau. George used filmmaking as a way to raise awareness about the struggles of the black community on a national level. </p>

            <p>However, reaching a wide audience was difficult since they were limited to playing films in special churches, schools, and “Colored Only” theaters. Financial difficulty pushed Noble to leave Lincoln Motion Picture Company to work for Universal Pictures. The studio closed not long after in 1922 and was a short-lived project with a lasting effect. </p>

            <p>The UCLA Charles E. Young Research Library’s Special Collections houses a physical and digital exhibit which recognizes progressive figures like the Johnson brothers and  highlights the accomplishments of the Lincoln Motion Picture Company. George passed away in 1977 and most of his films were not stored properly for preservation, but a compilation of newspaper clippings, photographs, publicity material, posters, correspondence, and business records are important remnants of the past that detail his life and legacy.</p>
