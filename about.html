            <h1>About DH 150</h1><br />
            <p>In Digital Humanities 150: Museums in the Digital Age, we explored how the roles of museums have shifted in response to the developing age of the Internet and mobile technology. With the increase of interactive exhibits, online access to the collections, and patron-curated exhibits, these technological advances challenge the traditional significance of material objects. Along with conducting visits to cutting-edge museums to observe how technology is integrated into the visitor experience nowadays, our class had the opportunity to curate our own exhibit based on the George P. Johnson collection in UCLA’s Young Research Library Special Collections. Considering how the students in DH 150 are studying a spectrum of majors - from the sciences to Design | Media Arts and everything in between - our roles in the making of the exhibit were based on our areas of interest or expertise. The curation, exhibit design, exhibit multimedia, and online experience teams all worked individually and collaboratively amongst one another, applying our class readings and discussions to our curation methods. Handling historical documents and artifacts as well as conducting research, our goal was to determine how to best depict Johnson’s crucial role as a filmmaker in the early race film industry to a modern audience.</p>

            <h3>A Message from Each Team</h3>
            <p>The Curation Team<br />“The George P. Johnson Negro Film Collection, 1916-1977, held in UCLA’s Special Collections, spans 71 boxes and features over 35 linear feet of content. Our team spent several weeks working with the collection, pouring over Johnson’s thorough documentation and preservation of black cultural production and black representation in the United States and abroad. We hoped to move through the archive and allow the story to emerge organically from Johnson’s collection. In the process, we were captivated by the story of George Johnson, Noble Johnson, and the legacy of the Lincoln Motion Picture Company. It was an honor and privilege to handle the hand-cut and thoughtfully indexed artifacts, to spend hours looking through beautiful film stills and photographs, and to learn about the incredible histories of the people who contributed to the Race Film industry.”<br />-Sarah Montoya</p>
