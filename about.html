            <h1>About DH 150</h1><br />
            <p>In Digital Humanities 150: Museums in the Digital Age, we explored how the roles of museums have shifted in response to the developing age of the Internet and mobile technology. With the increase of interactive exhibits, online access to the collections, and patron-curated exhibits, these technological advances challenge the traditional significance of material objects. Along with conducting visits to cutting-edge museums to observe how technology is integrated into the visitor experience nowadays, our class had the opportunity to curate our own exhibit based on the George P. Johnson collection in UCLA’s Young Research Library Special Collections. Considering how the students in DH 150 are studying a spectrum of majors - from the sciences to Design | Media Arts and everything in between - our roles in the making of the exhibit were based on our areas of interest or expertise. The curation, exhibit design, exhibit multimedia, and online experience teams all worked individually and collaboratively amongst one another, applying our class readings and discussions to our curation methods. Handling historical documents and artifacts as well as conducting research, our goal was to determine how to best depict Johnson’s crucial role as a filmmaker in the early race film industry to a modern audience.</p><br />

            <h3>A Message from Each Team</h3><br />
            <p>The Curation Team<br />
            “The George P. Johnson Negro Film Collection, 1916-1977 spans 71 boxes and features over 35 linear feet of content. Our team spent several weeks working with the collection, pouring over Johnson’s thorough documentation and preservation of black cultural production and black representation in the United States and abroad. We hoped to move through the archive and allow the story to emerge organically from Johnson’s collection. In the process, we were captivated by the story of George Johnson, Noble Johnson, and the legacy of the Lincoln Motion Picture Company. It was an honor and privilege to handle the hand-cut and thoughtfully indexed artifacts, to spend hours looking through beautiful film stills and photographs, and to learn about the incredible histories of the people who contributed to the Race Film industry.”<br />-Sarah Montoya, Adelaide Kuehn, Sarah Ohanian, and Aitana Balam</p><br />

            <p>The Interpretive Design Team<br />
            "As the Interpretive Planning and Exhibit Design team, we worked to bring cohesion and a unifying voice to the physical and digital exhibit of the George P. Johnson Negro Film Collection. We immersed ourselves in the details of the collection and its historical context, striving to interpret, narrate and honor the intention of Mr. Johnson and the artists whose work he so meticulously preserved. It is our most sincere wish that our work extends the voices of George P. Johnson, the Lincoln Motion Picture Company and the artists whose efforts established the genres of Race Film and Silent Race Film; from the past, into the present, and forward into the future. To that end, we worked to narrate the exhibition through object placement, sequencing of key themes, and the authoring of thoughtful contextual components to increase accessibility and understanding of these remarkable materials."<br /> -Anastasia Gershman, Brian Tran, and Francesca Albrezzi</p><br />

            <p>The Data Team<br />
            "With millions of artifacts, pieces of information, and everything else that exists in the world, recording and storing these things digitally in the most accurate way possible is of utmost importance. The data team, over the course of 10 weeks, has created a linked data model designed to not only catalogue and preserve everything available in the George P. Johnson Collection and on IMDb of early African American film, but also preserve the social context and ambiguity related to these artifacts. Throughout this process we met with data experts such as Matt Lincoln from the Getty Research Institute and Scott Carlson from Rice University to provide feedback and guidance on constructing this data model. Our focus was providing the technical foundation for the implementation of a linked database for early African American film. This work/paper provides future digital humanities classes and scholars the technical knowledge, data models, and examples for how to use this linked data model. We hope our work helps preserve such a unique and disappearing art that is such an important part of American history."<br />-Daniel Huang and Olivia Huang</p><br />

            <p>The Outreach Team<br />
            "As the outreach team, we have been tasked with the unique opportunity to market and share the exhibit in a way that captures the variety of audiences we believe would find merit in the George P. Johnson collection. Because of the intersection of race in America and the early film industry contained within the exhibit, our objective was to bring together everyone from film enthusiasts to scholars of African American studies to help share this particular and impactful portion of history. Our goal is to incorporate and educate those from within our microcosm of UCLA to those within the greater Los Angeles area."<br /> -Jenny, Geena, Sienna, and Nicole; IPAD Interactive: Aidan and Ariana</p><br />

            <p>The Website Team<br />
            "We were in charge of creating the website for the exhibit. This meant that we were in charge of displaying the information about the exhibit, showcasing an additional digital exhibit collection that the Digital Exhibit team created, and providing additional contact information with social media links. We wanted to create a website that was simple and user friendly, while also using aesthetic techniques such as red and black font and collaged photo background (courtesy of Graphic Design) that the physical exhibit used to create a cohesive connection between the digital and physical."<br />-Crystal Nguyen, Destiny Martin, Jennifer Williams, Jincheng Liu, and Zoe Hessler</p><br />
