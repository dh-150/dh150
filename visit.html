            <p>In a time and nation that struggled to accept racial integration and equality, race films were an uplifting symbol of the black community and its representation in American cinema. Race films catered specifically to a minority audience and were often screened for black moviegoers in designated theaters or matinee times due to segregation laws.</p>

            <p>While most companies that produced from 1915 to the early 1950s were white-owned, Lincoln Motion Pictures was one of the few black-owned companies that made a significant contribution to the growing collection of race films. Launched by brothers George P. and Noble Johnson in 1916, the company was a pioneering experiment that challenged the racial standards of filmmaking.</p>

            <p>George wrote scripts for all-black casts, allowing black actors to showcase their talent in an accepting space outside of a mainstream Hollywood that would otherwise portray the black community through a prejudiced lens. White-owned film companies always cast Noble as other races in his roles, but Lincoln Motion Pictures gave him the opportunity to represent his own race as the main star, breaking the degrading stereotypes influenced by the usual depiction of black characters in films.</p>

            <p>Closing in 1922 due to financial reasons, Lincoln Motion Picture was short-lived but lasting in effect. UCLA’s Special Collections houses a physical and digital exhibit recognizing progressive figures like the Johnson brothers and highlighting their accomplishments through Lincoln Motion Pictures. George died in 1977 and most of his films weren’t stored properly for preservation, but a compilation of newspaper clippings, photographs, publicity material, posters, correspondence, and business records are important remnants of the past that detail his life and legacy.</p>
